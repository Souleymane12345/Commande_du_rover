# Commande_du_rover

## Project context
In order to better assist people with reduced abilities in carrying out tasks that require a fair amount of effort, a mobile robot has been set up, the “ZBOT” robot. However, it cannot provide the comprehensive and effective assistance that will be most useful for these people. It is with the aim of filling these limits that we decided to work on the autonomous and secure navigation of the robot by designing a perception module, as part of ESATIC's internal projects.

## Primary objective
The main objective of this project is to ensure the autonomous and secure navigation of the ZBOT robot.

## Specific objectives
In achieving our main objective, we have specified it in sub-objectives which are among others:
• Ensure a good ability to visualize the environment.
• Control navigation with path planning.
• Detect and recognize objects.
• Calculation of the distance between the position of the robot and that of the object.
• Control the robot remotely.
